== Why Spring Boot?

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
To learn more about Spring Boot, visit http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot


include::{templates-url}/prereq.adoc[]

include::{templates-url}/getting-started.adoc[]


== Running Spring Application 

The application in initial directory is a basic SpringBoot app having 3 endpoints:

- *"/"* is the homepage returning "Welcome" string only
- *"/put"* is the page where key and values can be put on a concurrent hash map.
- *"/get"* is the page where the values in the map can be obtained by keys.

Build the app using Maven in the `initial` directory:

----
$ > mvn package
----

Run the application:
----
$ > java -jar target/hazelcast-spring-app-0.1.0.jar
----


Now your app is runnning on localhost:8080. You can test by following requests:

----
$ > curl "localhost:8080"
$ > curl "localhost:8080/put?key=key1&value=hazelcast"
$ > curl "localhost:8080/get?key=key1"
----

This part was an introduction of the applicaiton. You can stop your application by CTRL + C.

== Dockerizing the App

To create the docker image of the application, add following line into pom.xml file.

*Under properties:*
----
<docker.image.prefix>springio</docker.image.prefix>
----

*Under plugins:*
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.spotify</groupId>
    <artifactId>dockerfile-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${version.dockerfile-maven-plugin}</version>
    <configuration>
        <repository>${docker.image.prefix}/${project.artifactId}</repository>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

Then create the Dockerfile under `initial` directory named "Dockerfile" containing the instructions for creating a docker image:

----

FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine

VOLUME /tmp

ARG JAR_FILE=target/hazelcast-spring-app-0.1.0.jar

ADD ${JAR_FILE} hazelcast-spring-demo.jar

ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom","-jar","/hazelcast-spring-demo.jar"]
----

To create the Docker image of the app, first rebuild the app:
----
$ > mvn clean package
----
Then create image file:
----
$ > docker build -t hazelcast-spring-demo .
----

Now, the image must be seen among the docker images:
----
$ > docker images

REPOSITORY                           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hazelcast-spring-demo                latest              5f65a62b0aa0        19 seconds ago      122MB
openjdk                              8-jdk-alpine        a3562aa0b991        5 weeks ago         105MB
k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy-amd64          v1.10.11            7387003276ac        6 months ago        98.3MB
k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver-amd64      v1.10.11            e851a7aeb6e8        6 months ago        228MB
----

== Running the app in container

Now that the Docker image is ready, check if the image runs properly:

----
$ > docker run -p 5000:8080 hazelcast-spring-demo 
----

Test the app on the port 5000:
----
$ > curl "localhost:5000"
$ > curl "localhost:5000/put?key=key1&value=hazelcast"
$ > curl "localhost:5000/get?key=key1"
----

If you see the same responses as the ones you get when the app is run without container, that means it's all OK with the image.

To stop the container, get the container ID first:
----
$ > docker ps
----
Then find the application's container ID and stop the container:
----
$ > docker stop [CONTAINER-ID]
----


include::{templates-url}/start-cluster.adoc[]

include::{templates-url}/validate-kube-env.adoc[]

After you're sure that a master node is ready, create kubernetes.yaml under `initial` directory with the same content in the `final/kubernetes.yaml` file.

This file defines two {kube} resources: one statefulset and one service. 
StatefulSet is preferred solution for Hazelcast because it enables controlled scale out/in of your microservices 
for easy data distribution. To learn more about StatefulSet, you can visit Kubernetes documentation
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/

By default, we create 2 replicas of `hazelcast-spring` microservice behind the `hazelcast-spring-service` which forwards
requests to one of the pods available in the kubernetes cluster.

`MY_POD_NAME` is an environment variable made available to the pods so that each microservice knows which pod they are in.
This is going to be used in this guide in order to show which pod is responding to the http request.

Run the following command to deploy the resources as defined in kubernetes.yaml:
----
$ > kubectl apply -f kubernetes.yaml
----
Run the following command to check the status of your pods:
----
$ > kubectl get pods
----

You'll see an output similar to the following if all the pods are healthy and running:
----
NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hazelcast-spring-statefulset-0   1/1       Running   0          7s
hazelcast-spring-statefulset-1   1/1       Running   0          5s
----

Send request to port :31000 and see the pods responding.
----
$ > curl localhost:31000
----

And add a value to the map and then get the value:
----

$ > curl "localhost:31000/put?key=key1&value=hazelcast"

{"value":"hazelcast","podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-1"} --> the second pod's response

$ > while true; do curl localhost:31000/get?key=key1;echo; sleep 2; done
	
{"value":"hazelcast","podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-1"} --> the second pod's response
{"value":null,"podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-0"} --> the first pod's response
{"value":"hazelcast","podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-1"} --> the second pod's response
{"value":null,"podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-0"} --> the first pod's response
----

As can be seen, data is not shared between nodes. Here is where Hazelcast comes into action.
Kill active pods under `initial` directory by:
----
$ > kubectl delete -f kubernetes.yaml
----

== Hazelcast Caching among Kubernetes pods

Now we will use Hazelcast Caching among the pods. Update the pom.xml file by adding those dependencies:
----
<dependency>
            <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
            <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
            <version>${version.hazelcast}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
            <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
            <artifactId>hazelcast-kubernetes</artifactId>
            <version>${version.hazelcast-kubernetes}</version>
</dependency>
----
Then modify the CommandController.java such that Hazelcast is used in the map. Also add Hazelcast config to Application.java file and hazelcast libraries as well. 
Those versions are the ones under `final` folder.

Rebuild the app and create new image:

----
$ > mvn clean package
$ > docker build -t hazelcast-spring-demo .
----

Before deploying on kubernetes, create rbac.yaml file as in the `final` directory. Role Based Access Controller(RBAC) configuration is used to give access to Kubernetes Master API from pods which runs microservices. Hazelcast requires a read access to autodiscover other hazelcast members and form hazelcast cluster.

Run the following commands to deploy the resources as defined in kubernetes.yaml and rbac.yaml in the specified order:
----
$ > kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml
----
----
$ > kubectl apply -f kubernetes.yaml
----

Run the following command to check the status of your pods:
----
$ > kubectl get pods
----

You should also check if hazelcast cluster is formed by checking one of the podâ€™s log file:
----
$ > kubectl logs hazelcast-spring-statefulset-1
----
You must see such a response at the end of the log:

----
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
	Member [10.1.0.52]:5701 - ac54036d-c16f-40ae-9531-93e6f0683cf9 this
	Member [10.1.0.53]:5701 - d963bb82-3842-49fd-a522-82c8543bdb9d
]
----
If it's not seen, wait for  pods to be configured and try again.


Now we expect all nodes to give the same value for the same key put on the map via one pod only. Let's try:

----
$ > curl "http://localhost:31000/put?key=key1&value=hazelcast"

	{"value":"hazelcast","podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-1"} --> pod1 responsed

$ > while true; do curl localhost:31000/get?key=key1;echo; sleep 2; done

	{"value":"hazelcast","podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-1"} --> pod1 responsed
	{"value":"hazelcast","podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-1"} --> pod1 responsed
	{"value":"hazelcast","podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-0"} --> pod0 responsed

----

As can be seen, the insertion is made on hazelcast-spring-statefulset-1 but both nodes gives the same value for the key now.

== Scaling with Hazelcast

Scale the cluster with one more pod and see that you still retrieve the shared data.

[role='command']
```
$ > kubectl scale statefulset hazelcast-spring-statefulset --replicas=3
```

Run following command to see the latest status of the pods
[role='command']
```
$ > kubectl get pods
```

As you can see, a new pod `hazelcast-spring-statefulset-2` has joined to the cluster.
[source, role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hazelcast-spring-statefulset-0   1/1       Running   0          8m
hazelcast-spring-statefulset-1   1/1       Running   0          8m
hazelcast-spring-statefulset-2   1/1       Running   0          31s
----

Run the following command again to see the output
[role='command']
```
$ > while true; do curl http://localhost:31000/get?key=key1;echo; sleep 2; done
```
----
{"value":"hazelcast","podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-2"}
{"value":"hazelcast","podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-0"}
{"value":"hazelcast","podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-2"}
{"value":"hazelcast","podName":"hazelcast-spring-statefulset-1"}
----
As you can see, `hazelcast-caching-statefulset-2` is returning correct data.


== Testing microservices that are running on {kube}

Create a testing class under `initial/src/test/java/it/io/spring/guides/hazelcast/`
named `HazelcastCachingIT.java` .The contents of the test file is available under `final` directoy.

Also change the pom.xml file for the tests:

*Under spring-boot-maven-plugin:*
----
<!-- test executions -->
<executions>
        <execution>
            <id>pre-integration-test</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>start</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <skip>true</skip>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>post-integration-test</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>stop</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <skip>true</skip>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
</executions>

----

*Under dependencies:*
----
<dependency>
        <groupId>junit</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

The test makes sure that the */put* endpoint is handled by one pod and */get* methods returns the same data from the other kubernetes pod.

It first puts a key/value pair to hazelcast-spring microservice and keeps podname in the firstpod variable. In the second part, tests submits multiple */get* requests until to see that podname is different then the pod which initially handled */put* request.

In order to run integration tests, you must have a running hazelcast-spring microservices in minikube environment. As you have gone through all previous steps, you already have it.

Navigate back to `initial` directory and run the test:

----
$ > mvn -Dtest=HazelcastCachingIT test 
----

If the tests pass, youâ€™ll see a similar output to the following:

----
